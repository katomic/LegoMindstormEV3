# LegoMindstormEV3

Here are two files: an lxf to see the physical build for this robot (open with LEGO Digital Designer), an ev3 file that opens with the LEGO Mindstorms software.

This silly robot does not walk, but if you show it something red, yellow, blue or green it will repeat the name of the color, and flip one of its arms to show that color.
